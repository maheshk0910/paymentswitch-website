      <p>These Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Site or in respect to the Site constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us.

We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control.
